<p>Situated on an elevation of 5700 feet, Gorakh Hill is one of the most beautiful, the  coldest and the most amazing tourist spots in Sindh. Because of this elevation, in winters the temperature drops below zero and during summers it’s usually below 20 °C.

    The breathtaking view from the top of the hill station is something everyone needs to experience!</p> 

<h1 id="Kot Diji fort">Kot Diji fort </h1>
<img src="../../../images/sindh/Kot_Diji_fort.jpg" alt="PIC OF Kot Diji fort" heigh="200px" width="300px"/>
<p>Also known as For Ahmadabad, the Kot Diji fort in located in the town of Kot Diji in Khairpur. It is one of the most important cultural heritages of Sindh and was built between 1785 to 1795. Symbolic to the Talpur dynasty.

    The sheer scale on which it is built reminds us of what the construction in the olden times was capable of. The sole grandiosity of the structure can leave anyone breathless!</p> 

<h1 id="Mohenjo daro">Mohenjo daro </h1>
<img src="../../../images/sindh/Mohenjo_daro.png" alt="PIC OF Mohenjo daro" heigh="200px" width="300px"/>
<p>Located in Harappa, Mohenjo daro literally translates to “the mound of dead” (we’re looking at you BOLLYWOOD!). It is one of the most intriguing mysteries and also morbidly beautiful. Being there makes you feel like you’ve been transported. The intricate civilization and its structures and organization of the irrigation of sewage system is considered ahead of their times. Even the cultural advancements that have been studied, have seem to be more advanced than any other place at that time!

    The structure is now threatened by erosion due to improper preservation.</p> 

<h1 id="Frere Hall">Frere Hall </h1>
<img src="../../../images/sindh/Frere_Hall.jpg" alt="PIC OF Frere Hall" heigh="200px" width="300px"/>
<p>One of the many examples of Architecture from the British colonial era that still exists. It is also one of the few heritages that we have managed to maintain. Frere hall stands beautiful amongst the south part of Karachi with its magnificence.

    Visiting the hall is imperative while traveling to Karachi.</p>
