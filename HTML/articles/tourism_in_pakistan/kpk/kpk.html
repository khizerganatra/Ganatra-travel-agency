<p>Situated towards the west of River Kunhar, this veritable piece of heaven on earth is nestled at the base of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. Chitral is known for its captivating landscapes, fruit-laden trees, snow-peaked mountains and lush green meadows.If you really want to make the most of your time at Chitral, then visit the valley during the summer months when you will see fruit-laden trees of cherries, apricots and pomegranate. 

    Chitral is known for its picturesque Kalash Valley where you will find women dressed up in the traditional embroidered dresses and men with feather caps. Other places to visit in Chitral are the enchanting valleys of Broghil, Barmoghlast, Goleen and Ayun Valley. Garam Chashma is a refreshing river flowing freely through the valley and if you are a history buff, then you shouldn’t miss visiting the Shahi Qila, which is also known as Chitral Fort. It was built during the time when Chitral was a princely state, before partition. It housed the barracks of the guards of the rulers – Mehtars in local terms. 
    
    The best time to visit the valley is in between April and October. During the winter season, the valley is covered in deep snow. You can either visit Chitral by air and take a flight from Islamabad to Chitral or take a road trip to Chitral. If you are traveling by road, remember that it would take almost 10 hours to reach the valley via N-45 motorway. </p>

<p>Abbottabad serves as a transit city for tourists visiting the northern areas such as Nathiagali and Naran etc. Apart from being a stopover, Abbottabad is a beautiful tourist destination with many tourist spots such as Harnoi, which is located about 11 kilometers away from the main city center. 

    It is surrounded by tall green mountains and cold water streams that flow through the city. People who stop even for a day or two in Abbottabad, visit Thandiani, which is 31 km from Abbottabad and 2,700 metres above sea level. It is surrounded by lush green pine forests and the weather is bone chilling cold – hence the name Thandiani. If you are into history, then visiting St. Luke’s Church won’t disappoint you. Established in the 1860s, the building was established during the colonial times. The Lady Garden Public Park predates the partition era, when British ladies from the elite group used to visit the park to enjoy some relaxed time during the evenings. That is why many tourists who visit KP, explore the park because of its historical significance.</p>
